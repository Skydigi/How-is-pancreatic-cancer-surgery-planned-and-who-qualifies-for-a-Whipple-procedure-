Surgical planning for pancreatic cancer begins with accurate staging using contrast CT/MRI and, when needed, EUS to assess vessel involvement and nodal disease. Tumors are categorized as resectable, borderline resectable, locally advanced, or metastatic. Candidates for a Whipple (pancreaticoduodenectomy) usually have resectable tumors in the pancreatic head without distant spread and with vessels that can be safely preserved or reconstructed. Borderline cases may receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiation to increase the chance of an R0 resection. During surgery, priorities include margin clearance, meticulous vascular handling, and robust reconstruction of the bile duct, pancreas, and stomach/duodenum. Post-op ERAS protocols focus on fluid balance, early feeding, pain control, and monitoring for pancreatic fistula or delayed gastric emptying. Adjuvant chemotherapy is common, guided by pathology. Patients receive counseling on enzyme supplementation, diabetes risk, nutrition, and activity pacing. The goals are cure where possible, durable local control, and quality of life. Selecting the right sequence—neoadjuvant vs upfront surgery—can significantly improve outcomes, making expert evaluation essential.
